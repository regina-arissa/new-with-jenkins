# Integrating Github with Jenkins
1. Create a GitHub repository and configure it to be used with Jenkins.
2. Create a Jenkins job that is designated to run the pipeline. The job should be triggered
with a short delay whenever a new commit is pushed to the GitHub repository. So
once a new commit is detected, the job will eventually run without manual
intervention. You do not need to fully implement the webhook for automatic commit
events.
3. Define a pipeline with 7 stages, each stage should have a specific task to perform. You
will need to provide a description of the tasks performed in each stage and a tool
that could be used. Note that actual implementation of the steps is not required; only
the specified tasks and tools should be printed. The stages should include:

Stage 1: Build - Build the code using a build automation tool to compile and package
your code. You need to specify at least one build automation tool e.g., Maven.

Stage 2: Unit and Integration Tests - run unit tests to ensure the code functions as
expected and run integration tests to ensure the different components of the
application work together as expected. You need to specify test automation tools for
this stage.

Stage 3: Code Analysis - integrate a code analysis tool to analyse the code and ensure
it meets industry standards. Research and select a tool to analyse your code using
Jenkins.

Stage 4: Security Scan - perform a security scan on the code using a tool to identify
any vulnerabilities. Research and select a tool to scan your code.

Stage 5: Deploy to Staging - deploy the application to a staging server (e.g., AWS EC2
instance).

Stage 6: Integration Tests on Staging - run integration tests on the staging
environment to ensure the application functions as expected in a production-like
environment.

Stage 7: Deploy to Production - deploy the application to a production server (e.g.,
AWS EC2 instance).

4. Configure the pipeline to send notification emails to a specified email address at the
end of test and security scan stages. The notification emails should include the status
of the stage (success or failure), and logs as attachment.
5. Test the pipeline by making a few commits to the GitHub repository and ensuring that
the pipeline runs successfully, and notification emails are sent.
